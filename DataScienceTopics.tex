\section{Preprocessing}
\subsection{Principal Component Analysis}
\begin{itemize}
\item Reduce number of predictors
\item Reduce noise
\item Tackle multicollinearity
\item Interpretability could be hard
\item Should use the same PCA in the test and train datasets
\item Outliers should be removed before PCA
\end{itemize}

\section{Vocabulary}
\begin{itemize}
\item Generalization error: Out-of-sample error
\item Resubstitution error: In-sample error
\item ROC: Receiver operating characteristics
\end{itemize}

\section{Miscellaneous Notes}
\begin{itemize}
\item Types of errors: Sensitivity; Specificity; True positives; False positives; Positive/Negative predicted value (conditional probability)
\item Common error measures: Mean squared error; median absolute deviation; sensitivity; specificity; accuracy; concordance;
\item Use R package {\emph{caret}} for most machine learning purposes. R package {\emph{kernlab}} has a lot of data science examples. 
\item Machine learning algorithm steps: \\ Question $->$ Data $->$ Features $->$ Algorithms $->$ Prediction/Parameters $->$ Evaluation
\item Prediction is about accurace tradeoffs: in favor of simplicity, interpretability, speed, scalability
\item Training (60\%), Testing (20\%), Validation (20\%); OR Training (60\%), Testing (40\%)
\item Bootstrap could underestimate the error rate. Use the 0.632 Bootstrap to adjust for the error. Refer to Efron\_Tibshirani\_1997\_JASA.
\item If you transform the variables on the training set, use the exact same transformations on the test set.
\end{itemize}
