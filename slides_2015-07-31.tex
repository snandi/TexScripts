%% This is for 2015-07-31 meeting, with Prof. Schwartz & Prof. Newton
%% Updating them on statistical evidence that iterated registration 
%% works better than one-time registration, which is much better than
%% no registration

%% Outline for this presentation:

%%%%%%%%%%%% Slide 1 %%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Goal}
{\bf{GOAL: Establish uniqueness and reproducibility of intensity profiles of Nmaps aligned to any locations on the genome}}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%% Slide 2 %%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Estimation Steps ({\emph{M.florum}} data)}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Select the theoretical number of pixels for any length on the genome. Allow for $\pm 5\%$ stretch. 
\item Make all Nmaps (inside $\pm 5\%$ stretch) of the same length, {\textcolor{blue}{by fitting B-Splines}}
\item Pre-process the Nmaps to select the ones somewhat ``similar'' to each other, {\textcolor{blue}{by pairwise distance measures}}
\item Choose Nmaps that are not completely flat, {\textcolor{blue}{by choosing top 25\% or 30\% of most variable Nmaps, per interval/ fragment}}
\item Test for uniqueness, by comparing Nmaps from two intervals of same length, {\textcolor{blue}{by permutation test}}
\item Align the intensity profiles of Nmaps from the same interval, {\textcolor{blue}{by iterated penalized registration}}
\item Test for uniqueness again, {\textcolor{blue}{by permutation test}}
\end{enumerate}

So, for fragment 30, $175 \pm 5\% =(166, 184)$, Nmaps from 166 pixels to 184 pixels will be considered. \\
\pause
Take off 5 pixels from each end (punctates). Left with Nmaps between 156 and 174 pixels.
