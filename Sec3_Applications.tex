\subsection{Example of applying Fluoroscanning to mm52 genome}
For genomic variations like ``insertions'' or ``deletions'' in the mm52-post genome, use the prediction model to generate reference Fscan. For a normal sequence of the same locus generate reference Fscan. Compare the observed Fscans to these two predicted references. If the ``similarity'' between observed Fscans and the reference Fscan of the sequence with insertion, then it validates the Fluoroscanning can detect structural variations.

\subsection{Alignment of Fscans to reference Fscan}
What is the minimum length of molecule required to obtain uniqueness?
