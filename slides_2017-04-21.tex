Consider a cFscan $f(x)$, where $x$ denotes pixels.
\begin{itemize}
\item At each pixel $x$, a discretized representation of $f(x)$ is $f(x) > 0, f'(x) > 0, f''(x) > 0$
\item The discretized representation consisted of eight possible states $A: (1,1,1), B:(1,0,1), C:(1,1,0), D:(1,0,0), E:(0,1,1), F:(0,0,1), G:(0,1,0), H:(0,0,0)$

METHOD
\begin{itemize}
\item Randomly select 1,000 intervals from 21,972 intervals in the dataset
\item Randomly choose 4kb (20 states), 5kb (25 states), ..., 8kb (40 states) and count the empirical frequency in the rest of the interval
\end{itemize}
