\frametitle{Background: Genome sequencing}
Genome sequencing \footnote{http://www.genomenewsnetwork.org/} is figuring out the order of DNA nucleotides, or bases that make up an organism's DNA. The human genome is made up of over 3 billion of these nucleic acids. A DNA sequence that has been translated from life's {\emph{chemical}} alphabet into our alphabet of written letters might look like this:
