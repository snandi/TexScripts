\frametitle{Background: Genome sequencing}
Genome sequencing \footnote{http://www.genomenewsnetwork.org/} is figuring out the order of DNA nucleotides, or bases that make up an organism's DNA. The human genome is made up of over 3 billion of these nucleic acids. A DNA sequence that has been translated from life's {\emph{chemical}} alphabet into our alphabet of written letters might look like this:

\frametitle{Background: Nanocoding}

\end{figure}

\note{
I will try to explain the work that spanned over 10 years, in one slide, so please bear with me.\\
(1) A restriction enzyme and dye are added to the DNA molecules \\
(2) Wherever the enzyme encounters the sequence GCTGAGG, a red dot is added, called punctates \\
(3) The labeled molecules are laid on a positively charged surface \\
(4) Images of the DNA backbone are captured \\
(5) Images are analyzed using proprietary computer vision softwares, and distances between punctates are estimated \\
(6) This is called a nanocode, similar to barcode

\note{
The sequence of lengths between punctates is called a nanocode, akin to barcode\\
It is unique to molecule, and it can be used to determine which location on the genome the molecule is from\\
Example, below is a reference map from a bacteria genome, and a nanocoded molecule

\note{
If we plot the pixel intensity of the molecules, between punctates, we observe these fluoresence intensity profiles. \\
The brighter the pixel, the higher the value of the profile.
