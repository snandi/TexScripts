\opening{Dear Hiring Manager:} 
 
\noindent %PARAGRAPH ONE: State reason for letter, name the position or type of work you are applying for and identify source from  which  you learned   of   the  opening.  (i.e.  Career  Development  Center, newspaper, employment service, personal contact). 
I am a statistics Ph.D. student looking for a summer internship opportunity, starting in June 2016. I would like to apply for ``Statistician/Data Scientist, Modeling and Analytical Services - Intern'' position at IBM. I came across the position at www.indeed.com.
 
\noindent %PARAGRAPH  TWO:  Indicate why you are interested in the position, the company, its products, services - above all, stress what  you can  do  for  the employer. If you are a recent graduate, explain how your academic background makes you a qualified candidate  for the  position.  If  you have practical work experience, point out specific achievements or unique qualifications. Try not to repeat the  same  information  the reader will find in the resume. Refer the reader to the enclosed resume or application which summarizes your  qualifications,  training,  and experiences. The purpose of this section is to strengthen your resume  by  providing  details which bring your experiences to life. 
I have a combined experience of seven years in the statistical consulting and quantitave trading industries, before coming back to graduate school. As a statistics Ph.D. student, I have trained in theoretical and computational aspects of statistics and machine learning. I would like to leverage my data science background to address real problems pertaining to improving daily lives. I believe a data scientist should be involved in all four stages of data analysis: (1) understanding of the data generation mechanism, along with the assumptions and limitations; (2) cleaning and pre-processing the data; (3) analyzing the data to answer the hypotheses; (4) visualize the results and different scenarios. I have academic and industry experience in all the above stages of data analysis. I have experience of handling large datasets (several GBs), including high-throughput and high-performance computing on the \href{http://www.opensciencegrid.org/}{open science grid}. I have experience in most distributions of unix, and often use classical unix programs such as sed, vi, bash, for efficient data mining purposes. Data science is far beyond applying a few statistics and machine learning algorithm and my arsenal of skills is quite well rounded to be an efficient data scientist. 

In addition to my doctoral education in statistics, my experiences in consulting and wall street provide me a competitive edge. I have experience working and leading teams of different sizes. I excel in projects with aggressive deadlines. I also enjoy exploratory research projects that intend to push the boundary of human knowledge outward, which is one reason why I returned to graduate school. I am innovative, diligent, hard-working and persistent. 

\noindent %PARAGRAPH THREE: Request a personal interview and  indicate  your flexibility as to the time and place. Repeat your phone number in the letter and offer assistance to help in a speedy response. For example,  state that you will be in the city where the company is located on a certain date and would like to set up an  interview. Or,  state  that  you  will  call  on a certain date to set up an interview. End the letter by thanking  the  employer  for  taking time to consider your credentials. 
I enjoy working in an dynamic environment like that of IBM's, finding creative solutions to complex problems in efficient manner. I will be a great fit for the Data Scientist, Modeling and Analytical Services intern position at IBM. I am available for a phone interview on most weekdays. 

Thank you for your time and considering my candidacy. 
 
\closing{Sincerely yours,}
