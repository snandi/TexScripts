\opening{Dear Dr. Malloy,} 
 
\noindent %PARAGRAPH ONE: State reason for letter, name the position or type of work you are applying for and identify source from  which  you learned   of   the  opening.  (i.e.  Career  Development  Center, newspaper, employment service, personal contact). 
I am a doctoral candidate in statistics at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. I would like to apply for ``Data Science Intern'' position, at comScore Labs.
 
\noindent %PARAGRAPH  TWO:  Indicate why you are interested in the position, the company, its products, services - above all, stress what  you can  do  for  the employer. If you are a recent graduate, explain how your academic background makes you a qualified candidate  for the  position.  If  you have practical work experience, point out specific achievements or unique qualifications. Try not to repeat the  same  information  the reader will find in the resume. Refer the reader to the enclosed resume or application which summarizes your  qualifications,  training,  and experiences. The purpose of this section is to strengthen your resume  by  providing  details which bring your experiences to life. 
I have a combined experience of seven years in the statistical consulting and quantitave trading industries, before returning to graduate school. In the statistics doctoral program, I have trained in theoretical and computational aspects of statistics and machine learning. I would like to leverage my data science background to address real problems pertaining to improving daily lives. I believe a data scientist should be involved in all four stages of data analysis: (1) understanding of the data generation steps, along with the assumptions and limitations; (2) cleaning and pre-processing the data; (3) visualizing potential patterns in the data; and (4) analyzing the data making inferences about hypothesis. I have academic and industry experience in all the above stages of data science. I have experience of handling large datasets, including high-throughput and high-performance computing on the \href{http://www.opensciencegrid.org/}{open science grid}. I have experience in most distributions of unix, and often use classical unix programs such as sed, vi, bash, for efficient data mining. Data science is far beyond applying statistics and machine learning algorithms and my arsenal of skills is well rounded to be an efficient data scientist. 

In addition to my doctoral education in statistics, my experiences in consulting and wall street provide me a competitive edge. I have worked in and led teams of different sizes. I excel in projects with aggressive deadlines. I also enjoy exploratory research projects that push the boundary of human knowledge, which is one reason why I returned to graduate school. I am innovative, diligent, hard-working and persistent. 

\noindent %PARAGRAPH THREE: Request a personal interview and  indicate  your flexibility as to the time and place. Repeat your phone number in the letter and offer assistance to help in a speedy response. For example,  state that you will be in the city where the company is located on a certain date and would like to set up an  interview. Or,  state  that  you  will  call  on a certain date to set up an interview. End the letter by thanking  the  employer  for  taking time to consider your credentials. 
I enjoy working in a dynamic environment, finding creative and efficient solutions to complex problems. I hope to work on challenging data science problems to help make better decisions. I look forward to hearing back from you.

Thank you for your time and considering my candidacy. 
 
\closing{Sincerely yours,}
