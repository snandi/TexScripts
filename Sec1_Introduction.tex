\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Motivation}
An important component of precision medicine centers on obtaining and interpreting an individual's genomic background for the development of targeted interventions, tailored to that 
individual. Much of this effort will center on building large databases using critically developed approaches, both ``wet'' and computational that will allow researchers and clinicia
ns to wield detailed, molecular insights into disease that are specifically tailored to the individual. Although contemporary sequencing approaches have greatly accelerated the pace 
of discovery in the bio-sciences, current approaches show little promise towards achieving comprehensive analysis of large, human populations. Accordingly, the issues surrounding ``u
niversal genome analysis'' present challenges across a broad range of scientific disciplines and engineering domains.
