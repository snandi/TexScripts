\frametitle{Iterated Registration}
Similarity index:
\[ \rho(f_i, f_j) = \frac{\int _{S_{ij}}f'_i(s)f'_j(s) ds}{\int _{S_{ij}}f'_i(s)^2 ds \int _{S_{ij}}f'_j(s)^2 ds} \]
where, $S_{ij} = S_i \cap S_j$, the intersection of Sobolev spaces formed by the functions $f_i, f_j$.\\

Let $\phi$ denote the consensus intensity profile for a given set of curves. The objective is to maximize the average similarity to the consensus, i.e., maximize
\[ \bar{\rho}_{\phi, N} = \frac{1}{N} \sum \limits_{j = 1}^{N} \rho(\phi, f_j)\]
Stop iteration when $|\bar{\rho}_{\phi, N (t+1)} - \bar{\rho}_{\phi, N (t)} | < \epsilon$

\frametitle{Simultaneous Registration and Clustering}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Eliminate outliers by using ``data-depth''
\item Check if multiple clusters is better than one $\bar{\rho}_{\{\phi_1, \phi_2\}, N} > \bar{\rho}_{\phi, N}$
\item Model based, or k-means to get initial clusters, based on pairwise distances between curves
\item Estimate the medians, and ajust the clusters based on distance between medians and cluster members
\item Register to the median, re-evaluate the distances between medians and cluster members
\item Iterate until not much improvement in overall similarity index
\item Goal: To maximize $\bar{\rho}_{\{\phi_1, \phi_2\}, N}$
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Slide 5 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Functional Data Depth}
The univariate depth of the point $x_i(t)$ is given by
\[ D_n(x_i(t)) = 1 - \left| \frac{1}{2} - F_{n,t} (x_i (t)) \right| \]
where, $F_{n,t} (x_i (t)) = \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n}\Ind\{ x_k(t) \leq x_i(t)\}$ is the empirical cdf at $t \in [a,b]$ \\
Then, Fraiman and Muniz functional data depth is given by
\[ \text{FMD}_n(x_i) = \int\limits_a^b D_n(x_i(t)) dt\] \\
To detect outliers:
\begin{itemize}
\item Obtain the functional depths $\text{FMD}_n(x_1), \dots, \text{FMD}_n(x_n)$
\item Let $x_{i_1}, \dots, x_{i_k}$ be the $k$ curves such that $\text{FMD}_n (x_{i_k}) \leq C$, for a given cutoff $C$. Then, assume that $x_{i_1}, \dots, x_{i_k}$ are outliers and delete them from the sample.
\item Repeat until no more outliers
\item {\emph{But, how do you estimate the cutoff $C$}}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Slide 6 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Outliers using Functional Data Depth}
\begin{itemize}
\item Obtain the functional depths $\text{FMD}_n(x_1), \dots, \text{FMD}_n(x_n)$
\item Obtain $B$ standard bootstrap samples of size $n$ from the dataset of curves obtained after deleting the $\alpha \%$ less deepest curves. The bootstrap samples are denoted by $x_i^b$, for $i = 1, \dots, n$ and $b = 1, \dots, B$.
\item For each bootstrap set $b = 1, \dots, B$, obtain $C^b$ as the empirical $1\%$ percentile of the distribution of the depths, $D(x_i^b), i = 1, \dots, n$.
\item Take $C$ as the median values of $C^b, b = 1, \dots, B$.
\end{itemize}
