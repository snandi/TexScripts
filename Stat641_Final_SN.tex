Let $\hat{\beta}_u$ be the unadjusted estimate of $\beta$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ be the adjusted estimate of $\beta$. Let $\bar{w}_o$ and $\bar{w}_1$ be the means of $w$ in the groups $z = 0$ and $z = 1$ respectively. Then,
\begin{eqnarray*}
\hat{\beta}_a & = & \hat{\beta}_u - \hat{\gamma}(\bar{w}_1 - \bar{w}_0) \\
              & = & 0.7545 - 0.4250 \cdot 0.1574 \\
              & = & 0.6876
\end{eqnarray*}
$w$ cannot be a confounder because this is a randomized trial.

\item[(a)] 
Assuming power = 90\%, $\beta = 0.1; \alpha = 0.025$ \\
Assuming equal number of patients in each treatment group, $\xi_0=\xi_1=\frac{1}{2}$ \\
Hazard ratio $= r = 0.8$ \\
By Schoenfeldâ€™s formula we have:
\[ \dfrac{(Z_{1-\alpha}+Z_{1-\beta})^ 2}{\xi_0\xi_1(\log r)^2} = \dfrac{3.24^ 2}{(1/2)^2(\log 0.8)^2} = 844.09 \]

%Assume no censoring. \\
The hazard rate $\lambda$ for the control group is constant at .10/person-year. The active group will have a hazard of 0.8/person-year. Hence, the average of the control and active group hazards is 0.09/person-year; The cumulative hazard is $\Lambda(t) = 0.09t, \ 0 \leq t \leq 4$. \\
The probability that a subject experiences an event before time $t$ is $1 - e^{-\Lambda(t)}$. If the total length of follow-up is $F$ and the length of the recruitment period is $R$, then the probability of an event is
\begin{eqnarray*}
\bar{\rho} &=& \frac{1}{R} \int_{F - R}^{F} 1 - e^{-\Lambda(s)}ds \\
           &=& 1 - \frac{1}{R} \int_{F - R}^{F} e^{-0.09s} ds \\
           &=& 1 + \frac{1}{0.09R}\left(e^{-0.09F} - e^{-0.09(F - R)} \right) \\
           &=& 0.2356
\end{eqnarray*}
Hence, the total number of events required is 844 and the expected sample size is $\frac{844}{0.2356} = 3583$. 

%If we assume Censoring times, $C_{ij}$ are uniformly distributed on interval $[F - R, F]$, then the expected sample size is given by:
%\[ n = \frac{(Z_{1-\alpha}+Z_{1-\beta})^ 2 R \bar{\lambda}}{\left(R\bar{\lambda} - e^{-\bar{\lambda}(F - R)} + e^{-\bar{\lambda}F} \right) \xi_0\xi_1(\log r)^2} = \]

The critical values at $t_k = (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0)$ are 3.2905, 2.9404, 2.7211, 2.5481, 2.4011.

\item[(d)] The non-centrality parameter is
\begin{eqnarray*}
 \theta & = & \sqrt{\I}\log r \\
        & = & \sqrt{D \xi_1 \xi_2} \log r \\
        & = & \sqrt{844 \cdot 0.5 \cdot 0.5 } \log 0.8 \\
        & = & -3.2413
\end{eqnarray*}
For any interim period $k$, $\Exp(Z_k) = \sqrt{t_k}\theta$. Hence,\\
$\Exp(Z_1) = -1.4496$; 
$\Exp(Z_2) = -2.05$; 
$\Exp(Z_3) = -2.5107$; 
$\Exp(Z_4) = -2.8991$; 
$\Exp(Z_5) = -3.2413$ \\
Hence, the critical values $a_k$, for rejecting $H_1: \mu \leq \log 0.8$ are:\\
$a_1 = -4.74, \ a_2 = -4.99,\ a_3 = -5.23,\ a_4 = -5.45,\ a_5 = -5.64$

\item[(e)] Power = $0.8160 + \sum_{k = 1}^5 \Prob(\text{Rejecting } H_0) = 0.8160 + 0.0380 = 0.8540$
