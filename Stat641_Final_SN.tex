Let $\hat{\beta}_u$ be the unadjusted estimate of $\beta$, and $\hat{\beta}_a$ be the adjusted estimate of $\beta$. Let $\bar{w}_o$ and $\bar{w}_1$ be the means of $w$ in the groups $z = 0$ and $z = 1$ respectively. Then,
\begin{eqnarray*}
\hat{\beta}_a & = & \hat{\beta}_u - \hat{\gamma}(\bar{w}_1 - \bar{w}_0) \\
              & = & 0.7545 - 0.4250 \cdot 0.1574 \\
              & = & 0.6876
\end{eqnarray*}
$w$ cannot be a confounder because this is a randomized trial.

\item[(a)] 
Assuming power = 90\%, $\beta = 0.1; \alpha = 0.025$ \\
Assuming equal number of patients in each treatment group, $\xi_0=\xi_1=\frac{1}{2}$ \\
Hazard ratio $= r = 0.8$ \\
By Schoenfeldâ€™s formula we have:
\[ \dfrac{(Z_{1-\alpha}+Z_{1-\beta})^ 2}{\xi_0\xi_1(\log r)^2} = \dfrac{3.24^ 2}{(1/2)^2(\log 0.8)^2} = 844.09 \]

%Assume no censoring. \\
The hazard rate $\lambda$ for the control group is constant at .10/person-year. The active group will have a hazard of 0.8/person-year. Hence, the average of the control and active group hazards is 0.09/person-year; The cumulative hazard is $\Lambda(t) = 0.09t, \ 0 \leq t \leq 4$. \\
The probability that a subject experiences an event before time $t$ is $1 - e^{-\Lambda(t)}$. If the total length of follow-up is $F$ and the length of the recruitment period is $R$, then the probability of an event is
\begin{eqnarray*}
\bar{\rho} &=& \frac{1}{R} \int_{F - R}^{F} 1 - e^{-\Lambda(s)}ds \\
           &=& 1 - \frac{1}{R} \int_{F - R}^{F} e^{-0.09s} ds \\
           &=& 1 + \frac{1}{0.09R}\left(e^{-0.09F} - e^{-0.09(F - R)} \right) \\
           &=& 0.2356
\end{eqnarray*}
Hence, the total number of events required is 844 and the expected sample size is $\frac{844}{0.2356} = 3583$. 

%If we assume Censoring times, $C_{ij}$ are uniformly distributed on interval $[F - R, F]$, then the expected sample size is given by:
%\[ n = \frac{(Z_{1-\alpha}+Z_{1-\beta})^ 2 R \bar{\lambda}}{\left(R\bar{\lambda} - e^{-\bar{\lambda}(F - R)} + e^{-\bar{\lambda}F} \right) \xi_0\xi_1(\log r)^2} = \]

\begin{tabular}{rrrrr}
  \hline
  Time &  Upper & Exit pr. & Diff. pr. & Nominal Alpha \\ 
  \hline
  0.2000 & 3.2905 & 0.0010 & 0.0010 & 0.0010 \\ 
  0.4000 & 2.9404 & 0.0040 & 0.0030 & 0.0033 \\

  0.8000 & 2.5481 & 0.0160 & 0.0070 & 0.0108 \\ 
  1.0000 & 2.4011 & 0.0250 & 0.0090 & 0.0163 \\ 
  \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
The critical values at $t_k = (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0)$ are 3.2905, 2.9404, 2.7211, 2.5481, 2.4011.

\item[(d)] The non-centrality parameter is
\begin{eqnarray*}
 \theta & = & \sqrt{\I}\log r \\
        & = & \sqrt{D \xi_1 \xi_2} \log r \\
        & = & \sqrt{844 \cdot 0.5 \cdot 0.5 } \log 0.8 \\
        & = & 3.2413
\end{eqnarray*}
For any interim period $k$, $\Exp(Z_k) = \sqrt{t_k}\theta$. Hence,\\
$\Exp(Z_1) = 1.4496$; 
$\Exp(Z_2) = 2.05$; 
$\Exp(Z_3) = 2.5107$; 
$\Exp(Z_4) = 2.8991$; 
$\Exp(Z_5) = 3.2413$ \\
Hence, the critical values $a_k$, for rejecting $H_1: \mu \leq \log 0.8$ are:\\
%$a_1 = -4.74, \ a_2 = -4.99,\ a_3 = -5.23,\ a_4 = -5.45,\ a_5 = -5.64$
$a_1 = -1.84,\ a_2 = -0.89,\ a_3 = -0.21,\ a_4 = 0.35,\ a_5 = 0.84$

\item[(e)] Power = $0.8283 + \sum_{k = 1}^5 \Prob(\text{Rejecting } H_0) = 0.8283 + 0.0380 = 0.8663$

\item[(f)] A plot of the upper and the lower boundaries:

\caption{A plot of the upper and the lower boundaries}
\end{figure}

\item[(g)] In order for the two boundaries to match, $\theta_{\text{new}} = 4.802$. With this new non-centrality parameter, the power is 0.993.
\item[(h)] For this $\theta_{\text{new}}$, we need 1853 events, and hence require 7864 sample size.

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] The log-rank Z-statistics are:

\begin{table}[H]

\begin{tabular}{rrr}
  \hline
  Period & $\chi^2$ & Z \\ 
  \hline
  1 & 0.0203 & -0.1425 \\ 
  2 & 0.5249 & 0.7245 \\ 
  3 & 1.7033 & 1.3051 \\

\end{table}
Since the problem statement indicates that a positive $Z$ corresponds to benefit for treatment 1, we use the observed and expected values from the above to determine the sign. In each case, except for interim period 1, the observed number of deaths in group 1 is smaller than the expected, indicating that the observed treatment difference favors group 1.

\item[(b)] Based on problem 5(h), where required number of events is 1853, the information fractions are $0.1241, 0.2472, 0.3400, 0.4317, 1.0000$ and the critical points are:

  0.1241 & 3.5500 & 0.0004 & 0.0004 & 0.0004 \\ 
  0.2472 & 3.2319 & 0.0015 & 0.0011 & 0.0012 \\ 
  0.3400 & 3.1086 & 0.0029 & 0.0014 & 0.0019 \\

  \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
None of the Z-statistics of interim periods exceed the critical levels, so the stopping boundaries won't be crossed at any of the interim analysis. 

\item[(c)] The information fractions based on observed data are $0.2018, 0.4018, 0.5526, 0.7018, 1.0000$. The critical value at the final analysis is 2.3667.

\item[(d)] The Z-statistics at each of the interim analyses are within the monitoring boundaries, so the trial would not have stopped early on that basis. At the final analysis, the Z crosses the upper boundary, so we would have demonstrated that treatment 1 is superior to treatment 0.

\item[(e)] For stagewise, we need the probability of stopping early plus the probablity of going to the end and observing a final Z at least as large as that observed. Using the upper bounds of the interim periods from part 6(b) and the final upper bound from part 6(c), the stagewise p-value is 0.0100. \\

To estimate the LR orderings p-values, we need to estimate the exit probabilities: \\
LR1 exit: $0.0001925816$\\
LR2 exit: $0.0001925816 0.0088435372$\\
LR3 exit: $0.0001925816 0.0005709759 0.0083912392$\\
LR4 exit: $0.0001925816 0.0005709759 0.0006812452 0.0079284263$\\
LR5 exit: $0.0001925816 0.0005709759 0.0006812452 0.0008849474 0.0076769178$\\
Using the final exit probability in each set, the Likelihood-ratio p-value is 0.0330.
