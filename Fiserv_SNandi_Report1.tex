\section*{Introduction}
Answers to the following fitness test questions were evaluated, to identify any pattern between leaders who completed {\bf{LDP}} and those who didn't. 
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l|c|p{5in}}
\hline
Goals 		& Q1 & I have clear agreements with my manager about my identified goals. \\
      		& Q2 & My manager holds me accountable to have SMART goals (specific, motivating, attainable, relevant and trackable). \\
      		& Q3 & I understand how my goals are related to/ directly aligned to the overall organization’s goals. \\
		& Q4 & My mutually agreed upon goals are motivating and appropriately challenging. \\
\hline
Diagnosing	& Q1 & My manager is able to fully assess my competence (knowledge and skill) for each one of my identified goals. \\
		& Q2 & My manager’s leadership style depends on my needs on a specific goal/task. \\
		& Q3 & My manager stays connected with what I am doing and gives me appropriate feedback. \\
		& Q4 & My manager asks how he/ she can support me as a leader.\\
\hline
Matching	& Q1 & My manager is able to assess my commitment (motivation and confidence) on each of my goals. \\
		& Q2 & My manager knows when to allow me to figure situations out and acts as a sounding board, not a provider of directives. \\
		& Q3 & My manager is comfortable being directive. \\
		& Q4 & My manager is comfortable being supportive. \\
\hline
Coaching	& Q1 & My manager is able to effectively coach me through potential challenges as I work towards my goals. \\
		& Q2 & I meet regularly one on one with my manager so I can ask for the direction and support I need. \\
		& Q3 & My manager invites feedback about how he or she could be more effective as a leader. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section*{Model Fitting}
As can be noticed in the boxplots in the end of the report, none of the answers to the 15 questions above illustrate any obvious difference between the leaders who completed {\bf{LDP}} and those who didn't. This observation was consistent when a logistic regression model was fit to the data. Below is a summary of the model fit. As can be seen in the table other than Goals-Q1, none of the answers have any significant association with LDP completion. The p-values are greater than 0.05, hence, the associations are not statistically significant. 

Individual t-test results between the two groups yield similar results. For example, testing the hypothesis
$$H_0: \mu_{G1_A} = \mu_{G1_B} \hspace{1cm} vs \hspace{1cm} H_a: \mu_{G1_A} < \mu_{G1_B}$$ where $\mu_{G1_A}:$ Mean of answers of Goals, Q1 for leaders who did not complete LDP and $\mu_{G1_B}:$ Mean of answers of Goals, Q1 for leaders who completed LDP, two sample t-test yields 
$t = 0.207, \ df = 65.358, \ \text{p-value} = 0.5817$

When individual questions didn't yield significant results, average of each category was tested. For example, a new covariate $Goals_{Avg}$ was created, that was the average of all the questions related to Goals. Similarly, $Diagnosing_{Avg}$, $Matching_{Avg}$ and $Coaching_{Avg}$. Below is the result of the model fit

\end{table}

Even in this model none of the question categories seem to yield statistically significant associations with LDP completions. 

Performance Rating of 2014 was then tested with LDP completion to detect any effect. Only three types of performance rating had big sample size to compare.

Pearson's Chi-squared test yields $\chi^2 = 3.8093, df = 2, \text{p-value} = 0.1489$. There is no statistically significant association between LDP completion and performance ratings.
